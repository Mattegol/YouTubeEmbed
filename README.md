Embedding videos using YouTube's iFrame embed code sucks. Just how much does it suck you might ask? Well, 
each YouTube video you embed forces the user to download roughly 400K of data before they even click play.

Use jquery.nonSuckyYouTubeEmbed.js for a huge performance boost whenever your site calls for embedded YouTube videos. 
This plugin takes the YouTube video ID as the ID attribute of the element it is called on and fetches the thumbnail image and displays that first (with a play button laid over). Only when the thumbnail is clicked does it fetch the heavy iFrame. Optimized for responsive design environments!
